# Cleaning Text Data 

🧹Oh no! This text is messy...🧹

Cleaning text data is a must before we want to create a Word2Vec or GloVe or whatever fancy model you got out there. From removing unnecesary apostrophes until converting slang word into its dictionary entry. 

This tutorial is focusing on how to cleaning the text data directly from the .json file using Python. Hope it is useful! 🙏
